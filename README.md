# Personalized-medical-recommendation-System
The Personalized Medical Recommendation System is a smart, AI-powered web application that predicts medical conditions based on user-entered symptoms and recommends appropriate treatments. 


🏗 Technologies Used

        Python

        TensorFlow / Keras – for training the condition prediction model

        Scikit-learn – for label encoding and TF-IDF vectorization

        Streamlit – for building the user interface

        Pandas – for data manipulation

        OpenPyXL – for reading Excel data



📊 Dataset
 
        Contains 49 real-world medical entries.

        Columns include: Condition, Symptoms, Drug Name, Drug Class, Dosage, Side Effects.


🎯 Key Features

        ✅ Symptom-based Condition Prediction
        
        Uses a trained deep learning model (TensorFlow) to predict the most likely medical condition.


        ✅ Treatment Recommendation
        
        Uses TF-IDF and similarity matching to recommend drug name, class, dosage, and side effects.


        ✅ Dual Input System
        
        Users can either enter symptoms or search by a known condition.


        ✅ Clean and Responsive Streamlit UI
        
        Built with user-friendly design and feedback handling.


        ✅ Custom Preprocessing
        
        Ensures consistency between training and real-time input using lowercasing, punctuation removal, etc.
